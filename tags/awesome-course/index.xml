1 Daemons Most computers have a series of processes that are always running in the background rather than waiting for a user to launch them and interact with them. These processes are called daemons and the programs that run as daemons often end with a d to indicate so. For example sshd, the SSH daemon, is the program responsible for listening to incoming SSH requests and checking that the remote user has the necessary credentials to log in.</description></item><item><title>[MIT-missing] 06 Security &amp; Cryptography</title><link>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing6/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 14:51:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing6/</guid><description>Security and Cryptography - missing-semester
1 Entropy Entropy is a measure of randomness. This is useful, for example, when determining the strength of a password. Entropy is measured in bits, and when selecting uniformly at random from a set of possible outcomes, the entropy is equal to log_2(# of possibilities). A fair coin flip gives 1 bit of entropy. A dice roll (of a 6-sided die) has ~2.</description></item><item><title>[MIT-missing] 05 Metaprogramming</title><link>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 21:01:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing5/</guid><description>Metaprogramming - missing-semester
1 build systems make is one of the most common build systems out there. When you run make, it consults a file called Makefile in the current directory. All the targets, their dependencies, and the rules are defined in that file. Let’s take a look at one: paper.pdf: paper.tex plot-data.png pdflatex paper.tex plot-%.png: %.dat plot.py ./plot.py -i $*.dat -o $@ Each directive in this file is a rule for how to produce the left-hand side using the right-hand side.</description></item><item><title>[MIT-missing] 04 Version Control (Git)</title><link>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 22:11:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing4/</guid><description>Version Control (Git) - missing-semester
1 git’s data model 1.1 snapshots Git models the history of a collection of files and folders within some top-level directory as a series of snapshots. In Git terminology, a file is called a “blob”, and it’s just a bunch of bytes. A directory is called a “tree”, and it maps names to blobs or trees (so directories can contain other directories). A snapshot is the top-level tree that is being tracked.</description></item><item><title>[MIT-missing] 03 Command-line Environment</title><link>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 20:11:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing3/</guid><description>Command-line Environment - missing-semester
1 Job Control To kill a process, type Ctrl-C. To pause and backgrounding processes, type Ctrl-Z. 2 Aliases It can become tiresome typing long commands that involve many flags or verbose options. For this reason, most shells support aliasing. A shell alias is a short form for another command that your shell will replace automatically for you. For instance, an alias in bash has the following structure: alias alias_name=&amp;#34;command_to_alias arg1 arg2&amp;#34; Note that there is no space around the equal sign =, because alias is a shell command that takes a single argument.</description></item><item><title>[MIT-missing] 02 Data Wrangling</title><link>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 15:11:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing2/</guid><description>Data Wrangling - missing-semester
1 introduction To wrangle data, we need two things: data to wrangle, and something to do with it. Logs often make for a good use-case, because you often want to investigate things about them, and reading the whole thing isn’t feasible. Let’s figure out who’s trying to log into my server by looking at my server’s log: ssh myserver journalctl That’s far too much stuff.</description></item><item><title>[MIT-missing] 01 The shell</title><link>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 15:21:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lunarwhite.github.io/posts/notes/mitmissing1/</guid><description>Course overview + the shell - missing-semester
